## Unreleased

### Removed

- Removed "a.k.a." in feature descriptions in preparation for a separate `also_known_as` option

### Changed

- Renamed `ldc` -> `load_duration_curve`, `fluid/gas_distribution` -> `fluid_or_gas_distribution`, `fcf` -> `future_cost_function`.
- Simplified `asset__operating_constraints` by grouping features that span the time dimension (ramping, run up, etc.) into a `inter_temporal` feature.
- generalised `asset__operating_constraints.load_rate` into a `asset__operating_constraints.operating` feature for unit-commitment constraints.

### Added

- Added `asset__operating_constraints.inter_spatial` to capture operating constraints that span spatial regions.
- Added `transmission__opf.transport` to clearly differentiate energy transport flows from DC power flow.
- Added `postprocessing.aggregation` for methods to aggregate model components into broader classifications for dissemination.

## 0.1.0 (2025-10-16)

Initial release.

### Added

- Initial feature set.
- Schema generator.
- Tool feature list generator.
- PyPSA PoC feature list.
